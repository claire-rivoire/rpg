   abstract = {In recent years, several paradigms have emerged for interactive storytelling. In character-based storytelling, plot generation is based on the behaviour of autonomous characters. In this paper, we describe user interaction in a fully-implemented prototype of an interactive storytelling system. We describe the planning techniques used to control autonomous characters, which derive from HTN planning. The hierarchical task network representing a characters' potential behaviour constitute a target for user intervention, both in terms of narrative goals and in terms of physical actions carried out on stage. We introduce two different mechanisms for user interaction: direct physical interaction with virtual objects and interaction with synthetic characters through speech understanding. Physical intervention exists for the user in on-stage interaction through an invisible avatar: this enables him to remove or displace objects of narrative significance that are resources for character's actions, thus causing these actions to fail. Through linguistic intervention, the user can influence the autonomous characters in various ways, by providing them with information that will solve some of their narrative goals, instructing them to take direct action, or giving advice on the most appropriate behaviour. We illustrate these functionalities with examples of system-generated behaviour and conclude with a discussion of scalability issues.},

This paper tackles the problem of the dynamics of NPCs social relations
depending on their emotional interactions. First, we discuss the need
for a dynamic model of social relations. Then, we present our model of
social relations for NPCs and we give a qualitative model of the
influence of emotions on social relations. We describe the
implementation of this model and we briefly illustrate its features on
a simple scene.},

world. In PI, the personalities of the inhabitants are the base for the
game mechanics. When interacting with other characters the potential
emotional reactions depend upon avatars' current mood and personality.
PI is built with inspiration from personality psychology and affect
theory in an attempt to mimic possible emotional responses in order to
give the player support in role-playing. The mental states of
characters depend on their personalities and on their current moods.
Moods differ according to context and to recent experiences. Emotional
experiences become memories and define the relationships between
characters. The mental state is the sum of the character and governs
what actions can be performed in a given moment. In order to do certain
things the characters need to be in certain moods -- and for this the
players need to game their avatars' emotions, and game their
relationships.},
